⚙️ ETL workflow
This project follows a lightweight ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline built entirely with no-code and low-code tools:
<br>
| Stage | Description | Tool |
|--------|--------------|------|
| **Extract** | Job application data is collected via a **Google Form**. | Google Forms |
| **Transform** | A **Google Sheets** workflow cleans, structures, and enriches the data using formulas and custom logic. | Google Sheets |
| **Load** | A **Google Apps Script** updates the dataset automatically without overwriting existing records. | Google Apps Script |
| **Visualize** | The clean dataset is connected to a **Looker Studio dashboard** for interactive analysis. | Looker Studio |
<br>
<br>
🛠️ Tech Stack<br>
- Google Forms (data collection)<br>
- Google Sheets (storage & cleaning)<br>
- Google Apps Script (automation)<br>
- Looker Studio (visualization)<br>
<br>
<br>
🪜 Next Steps<br>
- Add AI-based parsing of job descriptions.
