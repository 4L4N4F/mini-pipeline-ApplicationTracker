A personal data project designed to track and analyze job applications. This project shows how everyday tools can be combined into a functional data pipeline (ETL) — proving that automation and analytics can be both simple and impactful.  


## 🎯 Goals

- Transform my job-hunting process into a structured, visual dataset  
- Track my job-search performance  
- Identify patterns and recurring skill requirements  
- Use data to guide my job-hunting strategy  


## ⚙️ ETL workflow

This project follows a lightweight ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline built entirely with no-code and low-code tools:

| Stage | Description | Tool |
|--------|-------------|------|
| Extract | Job application data is collected via a Google Form. | Google Forms |
| Transform | A Google Sheets workflow cleans, structures, and enriches the data using formulas and custom logic. | Google Sheets |
| Load | A Google Apps Script updates the dataset automatically without overwriting existing records. | Google Apps Script |
| Visualize | The clean dataset is connected to a Looker Studio dashboard for interactive analysis. | Looker Studio |


## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Google Forms (data collection)  
- Google Sheets (storage & cleaning)  
- Google Apps Script (automation)  
- Looker Studio (visualization)  


## 🪜 Next Steps

- Add AI-based parsing of job descriptions
